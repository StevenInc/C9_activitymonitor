# Angular2 Code Challenge

This coding example was written by Steven Benjamin

I wrote the example after completing an Angular 2 crash course from Udemy.

https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-crash-course/learn/v4/overview

The course included a base program that configured Cloud9 to run angular2
I found it useful and I cloned the base project to save time in setting up a cloud9 app from scratch.

All the code in the contacts and pipes directories has been written be me.

#To run this project:
type: npm start in the console below.
